The system for managing your employees vacations and days off is as simple as counting to 10. Employees wonâ€™t believe how quickly they are granted vacations or days off, and managers will adore the way our approval hierarchies are organized.
An automated attendance and departure system provides a clear idea of what resources are available in a certain period.
A clear advantage of the aWAY solution is that it involves employees in managing their vacation, who can check the balance of their days off, look at the dates available for vacation and submit requests.
